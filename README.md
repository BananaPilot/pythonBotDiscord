## Reaquirements

As said Franco_Bot is a plug and play bot so but still it needs a bit of configuration before.

## For Linux

- Having python installed and working on your machine

- Python must run with the command python and not python3 otherwise the shell script won't work (same thing with pip)

## For Windows

- Python must run with the command python and not python3 otherwise the shell script won't work (same thing with pip)

- Having [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to your enviroment variables [tutorial](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10)








## Installation for Linux

you simply need to clone the repostry and run this commands:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/BananaPilot/pythonBotDiscord.git
```

then create a file .env and copy this lines in to it 

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN = <yout discord token>

FFMPEG_PATH = ffmpeg
```

If you don't know how to get your own discord token follow this [tutorial](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/): 

Intead for the ffmpeg path for linux you can just leave it as ffmpeg it will autamitacally translate to the path
