## Requirements

As said, Franco_Bot is a plug and play bot, but it still needs a bit of configuration beforehand.

## For Linux

- Having python installed and working on your machine

- Python must run with the command python and not python3 otherwise the shell script will not work (same thing with pip)

## For Windows

- Having python installed and working on your machine

- Python must run with the command python and not python3 otherwise the shell script will not work (same thing with pip)

- Having [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to your enviroment variables [tutorial](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10)



## Installation for Linux

You simply need to clone the repostry and run this commands:

```bash
# Clone the repostry:
git clone https://github.com/BananaPilot/pythonBotDiscord.git
```

Then create a file .env and copy this lines in to it 

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN = <your discord token>

FFMPEG_PATH = ffmpeg
```

If you don't know how to get your own discord token follow this [tutorial](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/): 

Instead for the ffmpeg path for linux you can just leave it as ffmpeg it will autamitacally translate to the path

And finally make the shell script runnable then run the command

```bash
# Make the bash file runnable with:
chmod u+x launch.sh
# Then run:
./launch.sh
```



## Intallation for Windows

you simply need to clone the repostry and run this commands:

```bash
# Clone the repostry:
git clone https://github.com/BananaPilot/pythonBotDiscord.git
```

then create a file .env and copy this lines in to it 

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN = <your discord token>

FFMPEG_PATH = <path to ffmpeg.exe>
```
